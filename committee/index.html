      <b>President</b> Lily Travers (they/he)<br>
      <em>Hi everyone! I'm Lily, and I'm honoured to be your 2024 President! You may recognise me 
        as the outgoing First Year Rep for Research. My majors are physics and mathematics, and you'll 
        often find me in the commo working on problems with friends.
        The 2023 committee set a strong precedent for us to follow, but I'm so excited to jump 
        into the year alongside the wonderful 2024 committee. We are committed to bringing more 
        engaging events, both new and traditional, and I am focused on promoting inclusion of all of the 
        Advanced Science courses, especially Global Challenges and Data Science.
        I'd love to get to know you better, so please don't hesitate to approach me at events, in the
        commo, or just around campus. Can't wait to see you around!</em>
